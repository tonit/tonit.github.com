        <h1>What is Developer Ergonomics ?</h1>
        <h3>The problem</h3>
        <p>
            Some issues that persist in business software projects today, where technology is not the answer:
            <ul>
            <li>Why do so many business-software projects fail even though technology is being developed "for-free" by corporations like Google and Amazon having best-of-the-world talent? </li>
            <li>Software Developers often spend a large amount of their time on something called undifferentiated heavy-lifting. Are you aware? How can you improve?</li>
            <li>Why is top talent working not working for your company?</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
        <p>
          These are only a few of the problems. But i am sure you get the idea: The current situation is not good.
        </p>
       <h3>A possible path to fix this</h3>

        <p>
          Developer Ergonomics is about all-day mechanics to increase developer productivity, improve software quality and providing a good work environment to attract and retain top talent.
          Listening to Developers is the first step.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developer Ergonomics is about providing the right amount of creative space and meaningful borders which some also call railroads.
          Practically this means creating custom development kits (SDKs) that are suited for the job at hand. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Developer Ergonomics is not a single technology or principle. 
          It is a new view: Looking at how software is invented, being developed and how it is nurtured.
        </p>
        <h3>What is needed ?</h3>
        <p>
            Agile Management Principles, Containerized Solutions, Open Source Software. Its a good start but worth little without looking at Developer Ergonomics.
          </p>
        <p>
          We need better SDKs, clear guidelines understandable for everyone and meaningful governance for the digital age.
        </p>
