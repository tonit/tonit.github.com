        <h1>This is Developer Ergonomics</h1>
       
        <h3>Problem 1: Developers are puzzlers</h3>  
        <p>
            Software Developers are often not well attached to business goals. How do you find the balance between creative thinking and organizational governance?
        </p>
        <h3>Problem 2: Undifferentiated heavy-lifting</h3>  

        <p>Software Developers often spend a large amount of their time on something called undifferentiated heavy-lifting. Are you aware? How can you improve?</p>
       
        <h3>Problem 3: Talent Market</h3>  

        <p>Why is top talent working not working for your company?</p>

        <h1>The Solution</h1>

       <h3>Make the right things simple + Make the wrong things incredibly hard</h3>
       <p>
         Decide what is right and wrong in your platform design and project. <BR/>
         Build convenience into anything that supports the right path, and make fcking up almost impossible.
       </p>

        <p>
          Developer Ergonomics is about all-day mechanics to increase developer productivity, improve software quality and providing a good work environment to attract and retain top talent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developer Ergonomics is about providing the right amount of creative space and meaningful borders and railroads.
          Practically this can mean creating custom development kits (SDKs) that are suited for the job at hand. 
        </p>
        <h3>Developer Ergonomics is a key differentiator in digital transformation</h3>        
        <p>
           Developer Ergonomics is a new view at how software is invented, developed and nurtured. Read more on <a href="https://medium.com/rebaze/">The Rebaze Way</a>.
