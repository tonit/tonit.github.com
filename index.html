        <h1>What I can do for your team</h1>
		<h3>Component Lifecycle Management </h3>
		In the recent decade i worked with more than 15 corporations like <a href="http://www.db.com">Deutsche Bank</a>, <a href="http://morganstanley.com">Morgan Stanley</a> and <a href="http://www.lufthansa.com">Lufthansa</a> on a variety of technology and communication efforts.
			There i was able to develop deep expertize in those areas:
			<ul>
				<li>Build- and Test Pipelines using Maven, Nexus, Jenkins, Git etc.</li>
				<li>Modular Software Architecture (OSGi)</li>
				<li>Test Management &amp; Automation including Virtualization and Containers (Docker)</li>
			</ul>
			It is all about the leverage you unlock with technology that fits your needs. My company <a href="http://wwww.rebaze.com#onboarding">rebaze</a> is happy to share this expertize with you in your next project.
		<BR/><BR/>
        <h3>Technology Onboarding : Let's repackage work</h3>
	My passion is helping people getting started with anything in the most effective way. For me it is the mariage of an optimized integration process for new emplyees or project members, and the way you communicate within your team. <BR/><BR/><a href="http://wwww.rebaze.com#onboarding">Rebaze</a> helps you strive for the goal that anyone in your team (junior or veteran) can adopt any task with his or her best potential productivity.
	<BR/><BR/>
